## 1. ACTIVE MARS INSTRUMENTS

### Perseverance Rover (Jezero Crater, landed Feb. 18, 2021)

**SHERLOC** — Deep-UV Raman spectrometer (248.6 nm excitation) + fluorescence spectroscopy. Mounted on robotic arm. Maps mineral and organic composition at sub-mm scale. Detects Raman G-band (~1600 cm^-1, macromolecular carbon) and D-band (~1350 cm^-1, lower-thermal-maturity organics). Went offline early 2024 (lens cover issue), revived June 2024.

Key finding: Detected organic carbon at "Apollo Temple" in Bright Angel formation, co-located with vivianite (ferrous iron phosphate) and greigite (iron sulfide) — minerals that on Earth commonly form in microbially active, low-temperature aqueous environments.

**PIXL** — X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, ~100 μm resolution elemental mapping. At Cheyava Falls: identified sub-mm "leopard spots" — reaction fronts with dark rims enriched in vivianite + greigite, light cores. Organic carbon (SHERLOC) co-located with these mineral phases.

Rock matrix: fine-grained smectite clay mudstone (montmorillonite, nontronite) with ferric oxides (hematite, goethite), calcium sulfates (gypsum, bassanite), phosphorus and sulfur.

**SuperCam** — Multi-technique remote sensing:
- Raman spectroscopy (532 nm pulsed green laser)
- LIBS (vaporizes rock at >7 m range for elemental composition)
- Visible/Near-IR reflectance spectroscopy
- Time-Resolved Fluorescence for organics

**MOXIE** — Technology demo, not biosignature. Oxygen extraction from CO2 via solid oxide electrolysis at ~800°C. 16 runs (April 2021–Aug 2023), 122 g total O2 at ≤98% purity. Peak: 12 g/hr (2x NASA goals). Final ops September 30, 2024.

### The Cheyava Falls Discovery (July 2024)

- Arrowhead-shaped rock (3.2 ft × 2 ft) in Bright Angel formation at Neretva Vallis
- PIXL + SHERLOC: organic carbon co-located with vivianite + greigite in "leopard spot" reaction fronts and "poppy seed" nodules
- On Earth: these minerals + patterns = microbial iron/sulfur metabolisms
- Core sample named "Sapphire Canyon," carried aboard rover
- Published *Nature* September 10, 2025: "Redox-Driven Mineral and Organic Associations in Jezero Crater, Mars"
- NASA Acting Admin Duffy: "closest we have ever come to discovering life on Mars"
- Katie Stack Morgan cautioned: abiotic explanations cannot be ruled out; confirmation requires Earth-lab isotopic analysis + microscopy

### Curiosity Rover SAM (Gale Crater, landed Aug. 6, 2012)

Suite: Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer + Gas Chromatograph (6 columns) + Tunable Laser Spectrometer

Organic findings:
- **Chlorobenzene**: 150–300 ppb in Cumberland drill sample (Sol 290). Plus dichloroalkanes. Chlorination likely from perchlorate + organics during pyrolysis
- **Thiophenes** (thiophene, 2-/3-methylthiophene): Murray Formation mudstones. On Earth found in coal, crude oil, kerogen, stromatolites. Bio origin plausible but not proven
- **Eigenbrode et al. 2018 (*Science*)**: Confirmed thiophenic, aromatic, aliphatic compounds in Mojave/Confidence Hills. ~10 ppm organic C — 100x greater than prior detections
- **Benzene, toluene, propane, butene** also detected

Methane:
- Background mean 0.41 ± 0.16 ppbv, seasonal cycling (0.24 winter → 0.65 late summer)
- Transient spikes to ~21 ppbv
- Appears at night, vanishes by day
- 2024 study: barometric pumping mechanism proposed
- 2025 paper (Viscardy et al.): questioned detection reliability — foreoptics chamber has methane 3–4 orders of magnitude above sample-cell levels
- ESA Trace Gas Orbiter has NOT detected atmospheric methane from orbit

## 3. EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE CHARACTERIZATION

### JWST

**K2-18b controversy**:
- Sub-Neptune, 8.6 M⊕, 2.6 R⊕, habitable zone of M-dwarf at 124 ly
- Sept 2023: CH4 at 5σ, CO2 at 3σ. DMS at only 1σ (non-detection). "Hycean" interpretation
- April 2025: DMS/DMDS claimed at 3σ using MIRI mid-IR only (excluded near-IR data)
- Reanalysis (Schmidt et al. 2025): CH4 confirmed at 4σ, **no evidence** for CO2 or DMS
- Lab experiments: DMS forms abiotically under exoplanetary conditions
- DMS detected on comet 67P by Rosetta
- Multiple teams challenge hycean interpretation (magma ocean alternatives)
- No confirmed DMS detection. Laura Kreidberg: "even if there is dimethyl sulfide, connecting that to biosignatures is an enormous leap"

**TRAPPIST-1 system**:
- TRAPPIST-1 b: bare rock or thin atmosphere (ambiguous)
- TRAPPIST-1 c: dayside 380 ± 31 K, rules out thick CO2 atmospheres
- TRAPPIST-1 d: atmosphere ruled out
- TRAPPIST-1 e (key target): 4 transmission spectra from NIRSpec (2023). Weakly disfavor CO2-rich atm. Permit N2-rich. Not conclusive
- Cycles 3 & 4: ~130 hrs for 15 closely-spaced transits of e + b. Since b = bare rock, shared features = stellar contamination → subtraction method. Could detect Earth-like atmosphere at high confidence

### Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)

- ~6 m UV/optical/near-IR space telescope
- Coronagraph at 10^-10 contrast (planet 10 billion times fainter than star)
- Goal: directly image ≥25 habitable Earth-size exoplanets, spectroscopy for O2, O3, CH4, H2O, CO2
- Pre-Phase A since August 2024
- Industry tech proposals selected January 2026
- Proposed launch: ~2041
- At L2, serviceable

### Ground-Based ELTs

**ELT** (39 m, Chile): First light March 2029

- HARMONI: medium-res spectroscopy
- Could detect O2 on ~19 exo-Earths within 20 pc over 10 years
- Proxima Cen b: O2 detectable within ~1 week

**GMT** (24.5 m, Chile): First light early 2030s. ~7 exo-Earth candidates in 10-yr survey.

**TMT** (30 m, Hawaii — site contested): First light early 2030s. Northern hemisphere coverage adds ~25% targets.

## 4. LABORATORY TOOLS AND AGNOSTIC DETECTION

### Assembly Theory (Cronin, U Glasgow + Walker, ASU)

- Assembly index: minimum joining steps to build molecule from basics
- Non-living chemistry rarely produces high-complexity molecules abundantly (no template recycling)
- Validated via tandem mass spec: all molecules with assembly index >15 = living/technological systems
- Uses standard mass specs already on planetary missions
- Published: Nature Communications 2021

### ML + Pyrolysis GC-MS (Cleaves et al., 2023, PNAS)

- 134 abiotic/biotic samples classified at ~90% accuracy
- No specific compound ID needed — relational patterns only
- Works on ~14 Ma degraded samples
- Applicable to SAM-class instruments

### Ocean Worlds Life Surveyor (OWLS) — JPL

**OCEANS**: Capillary electrophoresis + LIF + MS + conductivity. Amino acids at nM–pM. Chirality assessment.

**ELVIS**: Digital holographic microscopy, no moving parts. Cells at ≥10^4/mL. Motility detection as independent biosignature.

2025: OWLS prototype at Mono Lake found life autonomously.

### Microfluidic Organic Analyzer (MOA)

- Programmable microvalve array + glass microchannels + LIF
- Fully automated end-to-end microchip CE
- Advancing toward TRL 6

### IRMS (Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry)

- Biological systems prefer lighter isotopes (12C > 13C, 32S > 34S)
- Cannot miniaturize to rover-needed precision — primary reason MSR is essential
- Challenges: need precursor isotopic composition; degassing can overprint signatures; bulk methods can't differentiate biotic/abiotic at Mars organic levels (~300–1200 ppm)
- Best approach: compound-specific isotope analysis + NanoSIMS

### Raman Spectroscopy

- G-band (~1600 cm^-1): graphitic/macromolecular carbon
- D-band (~1350 cm^-1): disordered carbon (preservation quality indicator)
- Deep-UV (248.6 nm, SHERLOC): resonance enhancement, reduced fluorescence
- SERS: metal nanoparticle substrates amplify signal orders of magnitude
- Limitation: cannot alone distinguish kerogen (bio) from abiotic MMC
