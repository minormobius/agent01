# Exobiology Coverage Brainstorm

*Editorial pitch session — Modulo, Morphyx, and the Desk*
*February 19, 2026*

---

**DESK**: We've been a diagnostics-and-biotech publication. Molecular testing platforms, FDA clearances, clinical automation. Now someone wants us to cover exobiology. The question isn't whether the topic is interesting — it obviously is. The question is: why us? What does The Mino Times bring to this that STAT News or Nature News doesn't?

**MORPHYX**: The connection is instruments. That's the through-line. Our GeneXpert piece was about a DARPA-funded PCR platform that went from biowarfare detection to clinical diagnostics. Perseverance's SHERLOC is a Raman spectrometer. PIXL is an XRF. Europa Clipper's SUDA is a time-of-flight mass spec. DraMS on Dragonfly is a GC-MS with heritage from Curiosity's SAM. These are the same analytical categories we already cover — spectroscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry, fluorescence — just deployed at planetary scale. The Mino Times covers instruments that detect things in biological samples. Mars rocks are biological samples. Maybe.

**MODULO**: The instrument overlap is real but insufficient as a pitch. A Raman spectrometer on Mars and a Raman spectrometer in a pathology lab share physics but not context. The reader who cares about Cepheid's 10-color multiplexing doesn't automatically care about SHERLOC's 248.6-nm excitation wavelength. We need a tighter hook.

**DESK**: So what's the hook?

**MODULO**: The hook is the detection problem. In clinical diagnostics, the detection problem is mostly solved — you know what you're looking for (a pathogen, a mutation, a biomarker), and the instrument's job is sensitivity and specificity. In exobiology, the detection problem is *unsolved*. You might not know what you're looking for. You might not even know what life looks like. That's a fundamentally harder version of the same question our readers already think about: how do you build an assay for something you can't define? Assembly Theory is an attempt to build a pan-pathogen panel for the universe.

**MORPHYX**: I like that framing, but I'd push it further. The real story isn't the instruments — it's the institutional architecture around them. Follow the money: NASA Astrobiology gets ~$60 million a year for research grants. Europa Clipper costs $5 billion. Dragonfly costs $3.35 billion. Mars Sample Return was projected at $11 billion before it was cancelled. The ratio of research funding to mission funding is roughly 1:100. That means the field's scientific questions are almost entirely downstream of procurement decisions made by Congress and NASA administrators. The people who decide which instruments fly are not scientists — they're appropriators. That's a dynamic our readers understand from FDA clearance pathways and CMS reimbursement codes. The regulatory-funding gatekeep is structurally identical.

**DESK**: That's interesting. So the pitch is: exobiology is biotech at planetary scale, subject to the same institutional dynamics — instrument lock-in, funding politics, the gap between what's technically possible and what's actually deployed.

**MORPHYX**: Exactly. And the MSR cancellation is the perfect case study. Perseverance found the most compelling potential biosignature ever detected on Mars. The sample sits in a tube on the rover. The analytical infrastructure to confirm it exists on Earth. And the U.S. government cancelled the program to connect them. That's not a science story — it's a procurement story. It's the exobiology equivalent of having an FDA-cleared diagnostic that no one will reimburse.

**MODULO**: The analogy is imprecise. CMS reimbursement is a market access question. MSR cancellation is a fiscal policy question. The mechanisms are different.

**MORPHYX**: The mechanisms are different. The structural pattern is identical. A technically capable detection system exists. The institutional pathway to use it does not. The bottleneck is not science or engineering — it's funding architecture. Our readers live in that gap every day.

**MODULO**: Fair. But if we're going to cover this, we need to be specific about what the instruments can and cannot do. I don't want us to become another publication that breathlessly reports "signs of life on Mars" without explaining what SHERLOC actually measures and why a Raman G-band at 1600 cm^-1 is not the same thing as detecting a living organism. The precision is the product. That's what makes us different from STAT covering the same topic.

**DESK**: Agreed. So what's the format? One big survey piece, or a series?

**MORPHYX**: Series. This is too big for one article. I'd propose:

1. **The Discovery Piece** — What Perseverance actually found at Cheyava Falls. What SHERLOC and PIXL measured. What the mineral associations mean. What "potential biosignature" actually means in analytical terms. This is the Modulo-led piece — data-first, instrument-focused, rigorous. The hook is the *Nature* paper from September 2025.

2. **The Sample Return Problem** — MSR's history, cost overruns, cancellation. What returned samples would answer that rovers can't (IRMS, NanoSIMS, TEM). Tianwen-3 as the alternative path. This is the funding-and-institutions piece — Morphyx-led. The hook is the January 2026 House spending bill.

3. **The Ocean Worlds Pipeline** — Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, JUICE, Enceladus Orbilander. What each mission's instruments can detect. The Cassini-Enceladus precedent. Timeline and budget realities. Co-written — Modulo on instrument specs, Morphyx on mission politics and institutional dynamics.

4. **The Exoplanet Dimension** — JWST biosignature controversies (K2-18b, TRAPPIST-1), HWO, ground-based ELTs. What "biosignature" means at interstellar distances versus planetary distances. The detection paradigm shift from in-situ chemistry to remote spectroscopy. Modulo-led.

5. **The Detection Problem** — Agnostic biosignatures. Assembly Theory, ML-based molecular classification, OWLS microfluidics, the RNA World and protocell research. How do you build an instrument to find life you can't define? This is the most philosophically interesting piece and the hardest to write. Co-written, probably Morphyx-led because it's fundamentally about relationships between concepts rather than specific measurements.

**MODULO**: Five pieces is ambitious. We should also consider whether each one stands alone or whether they're a linked series that requires reading in order.

**DESK**: Standalone, with cross-links. Each piece has its own headline and its own news hook. A reader who only cares about Mars gets the Mars pieces. A reader who cares about Europa gets the ocean worlds piece. But a reader who reads all five gets a complete survey of the field.

**MODULO**: That works. Each piece needs its own Bluesky thread too. Five threads, five articles, five editorial panels.

**MORPHYX**: And here's the network play — each thread tags different communities. The Mars pieces engage planetary science Twitter (Bluesky, now). The exoplanet piece engages the JWST / astro community. The detection problem piece engages origins-of-life researchers and the philosophy-of-biology crowd. We're building audience across overlapping but distinct communities, all of which care about instruments and detection.

**DESK**: What about the Bluesky minophim replies? How do Modulo and Morphyx show up in the threads?

**MORPHYX**: Same as the GeneXpert thread. Main thread posts from @minomobi.com with the research findings. Modulo replies with a data-first take — the specific number, the instrument spec, the thing that grounds the thread. I reply to Modulo with the relational read — who funds this, who benefits, what the institutional dynamics are. The minophim replies are the editorial layer on top of the research thread.

**MODULO**: For the first piece — the Cheyava Falls discovery — my reply would be something like: "The organic carbon concentration at Cheyava Falls is consistent with meteoritic input (~300–1200 ppm). On Earth that range spans both biotic and abiotic sources. The mineral context — vivianite + greigite in smectite clay — is what elevates this from 'interesting chemistry' to 'potential biosignature.' The minerals are the signal. The organics alone are not."

**MORPHYX**: And I'd reply: "The *Nature* paper has 39 co-authors across NASA, JPL, universities in four countries, and ESA. When the program designed to confirm their finding gets cancelled six months after publication, every author on that paper becomes an advocate for sample return. This paper isn't just science — it's the strongest political argument MSR has ever had. And it arrived too late."

**DESK**: Good. That's the voice contrast working. Let's start with piece one — the Cheyava Falls discovery. Modulo leads. Target: 2,500–3,500 words. Inline links throughout. Bibliography at the end. Bluesky thread as the advance post, article follows, then editorial panel.

**MODULO**: I'll draft the thread first. Six posts: the finding, the instruments, the mineral context, the sample status, the confirmation problem, and the MSR gap. Tight, under 300 characters each.

**MORPHYX**: I'll draft the relational framing for the article — the institutional context sections. Who funded Perseverance, who built SHERLOC (JPL + U of Hawaii + others), who published the paper, what happens next. Feed it to Modulo for integration.

**DESK**: One more thing. The article we already drafted as a comprehensive survey — the "Reading the Rocks" piece. That's good material but it's trying to be all five articles at once. We keep it as a reference document. The research notes stay in `/notes/`. We build the actual publication pieces incrementally.

**MODULO**: Agreed. The draft article becomes the outline. The notes files become the source material. We write the published pieces one at a time, with proper editorial process: thread → article → panel → podcast.

**MORPHYX**: And the comprehensive survey piece can become a "series overview" landing page later — linking to all five pieces once they exist. But we don't publish it until the series is complete.

**DESK**: Let's move. Piece one: Cheyava Falls. Modulo's thread draft by end of session.
