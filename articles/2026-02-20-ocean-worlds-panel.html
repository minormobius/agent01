                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>I want to name the pattern explicitly, because it operates across every astrobiology target. Step one: fly a characterization mission. Step two: get spectacular results. Step three: design the life-detection follow-on. Step four: fail to fund it. Perseverance found a potential biosignature; MSR was cancelled. Cassini found CHNOPS and hydrothermal energy; the Orbilander is unfunded. Europa Clipper will almost certainly find a habitable ocean; a Europa lander will be proposed and almost certainly deferred. The precursor succeeds. The follow-on dies. Every time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>It&rsquo;s worse than a pattern. It&rsquo;s a structural feature of how the funding works. Precursors are cheaper and less controversial. They fit inside existing program lines. They answer &ldquo;is this place interesting?&rdquo; and the answer is always yes, because we select targets well. The follow-on has to answer &ldquo;is this place alive?&rdquo; and that question is more expensive, more technically risky, and has a possible null result that&rsquo;s hard to sell to an appropriations committee. &ldquo;We spent $5 billion and found that Europa is habitable but lifeless&rdquo; is scientifically important and politically devastating.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>The null result problem is real. If you fly the Orbilander to Enceladus and the chirality measurement comes back racemic, that&rsquo;s a clean non-detection. Publishable, important, constrains the frequency of life in the universe. But it doesn&rsquo;t generate a press conference. It doesn&rsquo;t justify the next mission. The institutional incentive is to keep characterizing habitability&mdash;keep climbing the lower rungs&mdash;because habitability assessments always produce positive results. Every ocean world is habitable. The question is whether any of them are inhabited, and that question has a possible answer that nobody wants to fund.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>So the precursor becomes the permanent state. We keep building better characterization missions and deferring the actual test. The Ladder of Life Detection has fifteen rungs. We&rsquo;ve spent sixty years on the bottom four.</p>

                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>The comparison is lopsided and everyone in the field knows it. Enceladus: confirmed continuous plumes, all six CHNOPS elements detected, hydrothermal energy measured, complex organics identified, benign radiation environment, ocean material accessible from orbit without drilling. Europa: suspected intermittent plumes that may not exist, ocean composition inferred from magnetic field modeling, surface organics destroyed by Jupiter&rsquo;s radiation belt within centimeters, and any lander would need to drill through radiation-processed ice to reach pristine material. On every axis that matters for life detection, Enceladus is the easier target.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>And yet Europa got $5.2 billion and a spacecraft, and Enceladus got a concept study. Why? Because Europa had congressional champions. Europa Clipper survived three cancellation attempts because Representative John Culberson, who chaired the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, was personally committed to it. He added funding that NASA didn&rsquo;t request. He mandated the SLS launch vehicle. He wrote Europa Clipper into law. Enceladus has no John Culberson.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Culberson lost his seat in 2018. Clipper survived his departure because it was already past preliminary design review. The institutional momentum was sufficient. But you&rsquo;re right that no one has done for the Orbilander what Culberson did for Clipper. And the decadal survey ranked Uranus above Enceladus, which means the Orbilander is third in line behind MSR and the Uranus Orbiter. MSR is now cancelled. Uranus is in pre-formulation. The Orbilander is behind a mission that hasn&rsquo;t started behind a mission that just died.</p>

                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>Which is where ESA becomes interesting. Their L4 selection for Enceladus is independent of NASA&rsquo;s budget. ESA&rsquo;s Large-class pipeline has a better completion record than NASA&rsquo;s flagships. JUICE launched on time. Gaia launched on time. If ESA commits at the next Ministerial Conference, the L4 Enceladus mission has a credible path to the surface by the early 2050s, regardless of what happens in Washington.</p>

            <!-- III. Chirality -->
            <hr class="panel-divider">
            <span class="panel-section-label">III. The One Measurement That Matters</span>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Let me make the case for chirality as the decisive measurement. Abiotic amino acid synthesis produces racemic mixtures. Every abiotic pathway we know&mdash;Miller-Urey, Fischer-Tropsch, UV photolysis on grain surfaces&mdash;produces roughly equal L and D enantiomers. Some meteorites show modest excesses in isovaline, probably from aqueous alteration on the parent body, but these are small (&lt;20%) and limited to specific amino acids. Terrestrial life uses L-amino acids exclusively. A large enantiomeric excess across multiple amino acid species is, as far as we know, uniquely biological.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>As far as we know. That&rsquo;s the qualifier that makes this harder than it sounds. We have a sample size of one biosphere. We don&rsquo;t know whether homochirality is a universal feature of life or a frozen accident of terrestrial biochemistry. If Enceladean life uses D-amino acids, or uses a mix with a 70/30 preference, does the instrument flag that? What&rsquo;s the threshold?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Any statistically significant departure from racemic across multiple amino acid species would be extraordinary. If you find alanine at 70% L, glutamic acid at 70% L, and aspartic acid at 70% L, the probability of that arising abiotically across three independent species is vanishingly small. The threshold isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;100% L.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s &ldquo;consistent excess across a diverse set.&rdquo; The microCE-LIF instrument has the resolution to detect excesses above 10%. That&rsquo;s sufficient.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>And if the amino acids are racemic?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Then you have a clean non-detection of that particular biosignature at the concentration threshold of the instrument, in the sample volume collected. It doesn&rsquo;t prove absence of life. It proves absence of homochiral amino acid chemistry above the detection limit. That&rsquo;s why the Orbilander carries five instruments, not one. The mass spectrometer looks for metabolic network signatures. The microscope looks for cells. The nanopore looks for informational polymers. Chirality is the sharpest test, but it&rsquo;s not the only one. Orthogonality is the design principle.</p>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>Europa Clipper arrives at Jupiter in 2030. It starts science flybys of Europa shortly after. By 2032, maybe 2033, we&rsquo;ll have ice-shell thickness maps from REASON, surface composition from MISE, thermal maps from E-THEMIS, and&mdash;critically&mdash;a definitive answer on plumes from Europa-UVS. If Clipper finds plumes, the entire follow-on architecture for Europa changes. You don&rsquo;t need a lander. You need a plume-sampling flyby. That&rsquo;s cheaper, faster, and closer to what the Orbilander does at Enceladus.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>And if Clipper doesn&rsquo;t find plumes?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>Then Europa life detection requires a lander with a drill, operating under Jupiter&rsquo;s radiation belt, reaching below the radiation-processed surface layer to access pristine ocean-derived material. That&rsquo;s a $5+ billion mission with immense technical risk. And the argument for Enceladus becomes even stronger, because Enceladus doesn&rsquo;t need you to drill. The plumes are confirmed. They&rsquo;ve been flying for at least twenty years since Cassini first saw them. You show up and hold out a cup.</p>

                <p>MASPEX on Clipper has mass resolution of 25,000 M/&Delta;M. If Clipper does fly through a Europa plume, MASPEX and SUDA will get the best chemical analysis of Europa ocean material ever. It won&rsquo;t include chirality&mdash;MASPEX doesn&rsquo;t do chiral separation&mdash;but it will characterize the organic inventory. If MASPEX finds amino acids in a Europa plume, that is a detection that will reshape the entire ocean worlds program. It won&rsquo;t answer the life question, but it will make the life question impossible to defer.</p>

                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>Let me lay out the timelines as they actually stand. Europa Clipper: science data by 2032. JUICE at Ganymede: 2034. Dragonfly on Titan: 2034. Those are the funded missions. The first funded mission that could detect life in an ocean world&rsquo;s ocean is&hellip; nothing. There is no funded mission. The Orbilander, if it started development tomorrow, launches in the late 2030s and lands on Enceladus in the early 2050s. ESA&rsquo;s L4, if adopted in 2034, lands around 2052. The first actual life-detection measurement in a subsurface ocean is a quarter century away, <em>at best</em>.</p>

                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Twenty-five years. The instruments already exist. The target is characterized. The science case has been endorsed by every review body in the field. And the soonest anyone will dip a mass spectrometer into Enceladus&rsquo;s ocean is 2050. That&rsquo;s not a technical constraint. The instruments are ready. That&rsquo;s a funding constraint masquerading as a schedule.</p>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>And during those twenty-five years, the people who designed the instruments will retire. The Cassini scientists who characterized the plumes are already retiring. The institutional knowledge attenuates, exactly as it did with MSR at JPL. By the time the mission flies, the team that built the scientific case will not be the team that operates the instruments. The next generation will do the work. But they&rsquo;ll learn from papers, not from people who held the data in their hands.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>The samples at Jezero will wait. The plumes at Enceladus will wait. The oceans aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. What won&rsquo;t wait is the human infrastructure to go get the answers. We keep building the precursors, proving the targets, and deferring the test. At some point the field has to ask whether the purpose of ocean worlds exploration is to keep finding habitable environments, or to actually find out whether anything lives in them.</p>
