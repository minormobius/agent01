            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Let&rsquo;s be precise about what was measured. SHERLOC detected a Raman G-band at ~1600 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. That&rsquo;s macromolecular carbon. Not &ldquo;organic molecules.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;biological material.&rdquo; Carbon with sp<sup>2</sup> bonding. Graphite has a G-band. Kerogen has a G-band. Soot from a meteorite impact has a G-band. The G-band alone tells you almost nothing about origin.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>Which is why the <em>Nature</em> paper doesn&rsquo;t rest on the carbon. It rests on the co-location. Organic carbon spatially correlated with vivianite and greigite in sub-millimeter reaction fronts inside a smectite clay mudstone. On Earth, you see that pattern in waterlogged sediments with active microbial iron and sulfur cycling. The argument is: this specific <em>combination</em>, in this specific <em>geometry</em>, is rarely produced by abiotic processes. It&rsquo;s a Bayesian argument, not a detection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>And the base rate problem is severe. We have exactly one planet where we can calibrate the prior probability of that mineral assemblage being biogenic. The entire argument depends on the terrestrial analogy being valid. If Mars has geochemical pathways we haven&rsquo;t characterized&mdash;and a planet with a different atmosphere, different radiation flux, and three billion years less geological activity almost certainly does&mdash;the Earth analogy could mislead.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>That&rsquo;s the epistemological trap of the whole field. You can only recognize biosignatures you&rsquo;ve seen before, on the one planet where you know life exists. Every detection framework is a projection from n=1. The honest version of Duffy&rsquo;s statement isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;closest we&rsquo;ve come to finding life.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s &ldquo;closest we&rsquo;ve come to finding something that <em>looks like what life does on Earth</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Correct. And the paper is honest about this. Stack Morgan&rsquo;s caution is substantive, not pro forma. Hydrothermal alteration of basalt in the presence of dissolved phosphorus and sulfur can produce vivianite and greigite abiotically. The question is whether that process would also concentrate organic carbon at the mineral boundaries in the same spatial pattern. The paper argues this is unlikely but does not rule it out.</p>

                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>How does this compare to what Curiosity found? SAM detected thiophenes, chlorobenzene, aromatic hydrocarbons&mdash;specific identified molecules. SHERLOC detects a Raman band. Isn&rsquo;t Curiosity&rsquo;s data actually more informative at the molecular level?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>More informative about molecular identity, yes. Less informative about spatial context. SAM heats a powdered rock sample and measures what comes off in the gas stream. The spatial information is destroyed. You know <em>what</em> molecules were present but not <em>where</em> in the rock they were located. SHERLOC and PIXL preserve the spatial relationships. They tell you that the carbon is <em>here</em>, at the boundary of <em>this</em> mineral, in <em>this</em> reaction front. That spatial information is what makes the biosignature argument possible. A thiophene floating in a powdered sample is chemistry. A carbon signal co-located with vivianite at a redox boundary is potential geobiology.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>There&rsquo;s a diagnostic analogy here. SAM is like running a blood panel&mdash;you get the numbers but lose the tissue architecture. SHERLOC-PIXL is like histopathology&mdash;less chemical specificity, but you see the spatial relationships that tell you <em>what the tissue was doing</em>. The pathologist doesn&rsquo;t diagnose cancer from a chemistry panel. They diagnose it from architecture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>I don&rsquo;t love that analogy. Histopathology has a reference atlas of normal and abnormal tissue built from millions of human samples. Mars geobiology has a reference atlas of exactly zero confirmed cases. But the principle is right: context matters more than identity when the identity alone is ambiguous. And organic carbon on Mars is always ambiguous, because it has multiple plausible sources.</p>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>Where does the methane story fit? Curiosity&rsquo;s seasonal methane variation&mdash;is that connected to the Perseverance finding, or is it a separate thread entirely?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Separate thread, and possibly a dead one. The Viscardy et al. 2025 paper is damaging. If SAM&rsquo;s foreoptics chamber contains methane at 10<sup>3</sup>&ndash;10<sup>4</sup> times the levels reported in the sample cell, a sub-percent leak explains the entire measurement. That&rsquo;s not a definitive refutation&mdash;it&rsquo;s an alternative explanation for the instrumental signal. But it means the detection may be an artifact. And the Trace Gas Orbiter not seeing methane from orbit is hard to reconcile with a genuine surface source.</p>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>If the methane is real and subsurface, it&rsquo;s arguably a bigger deal than Cheyava Falls&mdash;because methane implies <em>ongoing</em> processes, not 3-billion-year-old fossils. But if the methane is an instrument artifact, Cheyava Falls is the only game left. That concentrates the stakes enormously on a single sealed tube.</p>

                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>IRMS, NanoSIMS, and TEM cannot be miniaturized for rovers. This is not a funding problem or an engineering timeline. It&rsquo;s physics. Magnetic sector mass analyzers need flight tubes. NanoSIMS instruments weigh hundreds of kilograms. TEM requires sample prep infrastructure&mdash;FIB milling, ultramicrotomy&mdash;that is intrinsically laboratory-scale. The confirmation instruments exist. They are on Earth. The sample is on Mars. The connection between them was cancelled.</p>

                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>Cancelled for fiscal reasons, not scientific ones. The House minibus spending package in January 2026 eliminated MSR funding. Before that, the Trump administration&rsquo;s FY2026 budget called MSR &ldquo;financially unstable.&rdquo; Before <em>that</em>, the independent review board said $11 billion was untenable. The science was never in doubt. The procurement was always the failure point.</p>

                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>I want to be precise: the science of <em>sample return</em> was never in doubt. The science of the <em>biosignature</em> is exactly what&rsquo;s in doubt&mdash;that&rsquo;s why we need the samples back. The argument has a beautiful circularity: we found something that might be life, but we can&rsquo;t confirm it without instruments that require the sample to be on Earth, and we cancelled the program to get the sample to Earth, partly because we hadn&rsquo;t yet found something compelling enough to justify the cost. And then we found it.</p>

                <div class="speaker morphyx">Morphyx</div>
                <p>The <em>Nature</em> paper dropped in September 2025. The House killed MSR funding four months later. Thirty-nine co-authors across NASA, JPL, and universities in four countries published the strongest case for sample return in the history of the program, and Congress defunded the program in the same fiscal cycle. That&rsquo;s the institutional reality. The scientific case and the funding decision occupy different causal universes.</p>

            <div class="panel-turn">
                <div class="speaker modulo">Modulo</div>
                <p>Different timescales, too. Scientific publications operate on 12&ndash;18 month review cycles. Congressional appropriations operate on annual cycles driven by CBO scoring and political horse-trading. A paper published in September cannot influence a spending bill drafted in July. The instruments for making the case and the instruments for funding the response don&rsquo;t even share a temporal frame.</p>

                <p>China&rsquo;s Tianwen-3 launches in 2028 with a return date around 2031. Different landing site than Jezero, so it won&rsquo;t pick up Perseverance&rsquo;s tubes. But if it returns samples and China builds the containment and analytical labs first, the infrastructure for Mars sample analysis shifts to Beijing. That changes the geopolitics of the entire field.</p>

                <p>The analytical question is instrument-agnostic. An IRMS in Beijing measures &delta;<sup>13</sup>C the same way an IRMS in Houston does. The geopolitics matter for access, publication norms, and sample sharing&mdash;but not for the measurement itself. If China returns Mars samples, the science can still be done. The question is who does it and under what terms.</p>

                <p>And ESA&rsquo;s Earth Return Orbiter development continues. If a future administration refunds MSR or a commercial partnership emerges, the orbital segment may still be available. The program isn&rsquo;t architecturally dead. It&rsquo;s fiscally suspended. But a suspension that lasts through a presidential term becomes a cancellation in practice. Hardware teams disperse. Institutional knowledge degrades. JPL already cut 550 jobs in October 2025.</p>
