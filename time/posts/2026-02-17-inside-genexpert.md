Inside the Cartridge: GeneXpert's engineering, from DARPA lab to 60,000 clinics
---
[Cepheid](https://www.cepheid.com) got FDA clearance for an [11-pathogen GI panel](https://cepheid.mediaroom.com/2026-01-20-Cepheid-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Xpert-R-GI-Panel-to-Support-Broad-Detection-of-Gastrointestinal-Pathogens) on January 20. Their first syndromic test. Direct shot at [BioFire FilmArray](https://www.biomerieux.com/us/en/our-offer/clinical-products/biofire-gastrointestinal-panel.html). But the panel is less interesting than the machine it runs on.

The GeneXpert traces to a 1993 DARPA-funded project at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. Allen Northrup designed a micro-engineered PCR cartridge for biowarfare detection. Founded Cepheid in 1996. Licensed the LLNL patents for $150,000.

First commercial deployment wasn't a hospital. It was a post office. 1,784 GeneXpert systems installed at 283 USPS mail-sorting facilities in 2004 to screen for anthrax. First clinical FDA clearance came two years later — Group B Strep.
---
The core unit is the I-CORE module: 1" × 4" × 5". Two PCBs with resistive heaters, a cooling fan, LEDs, and TSL257 light-to-voltage converters. Heats at 10°C/sec. A complete thermal cycler and fluorimeter the size of a deck of cards. Same design since the late '90s.
---
The cartridge is a sealed macro-fluidic lab. User loads sample (<1 min hands-on). Instrument's ultrasonic horn lyses cells through the wall. Syringe drive + rotary valve move fluids through extraction, wash, elution, PCR. No pipetting. No cross-contamination. Biohazard contained.
---
The real breakthrough: 10-color detection from 6-color hardware. Cepheid synthesized 4 novel large-Stokes-shift dyes. Same LED excites two dyes, detector resolves two emission peaks. No new LEDs, detectors, or filters. Just a recalibration. Field-upgradeable.
---
Then they layered on "sloppy molecular beacons" — probes with deliberate mismatches that bind multiple targets at different melting temperatures. 5 targets per color channel × 10 colors = 50-target resolution. One tube. No sample splitting.
---
Proof of concept: the Xpert MTB/XDR test (2020). Detects 32 drug resistance mutations in a single cartridge in under 90 minutes. On the same module that ran a single-plex strep test in 2006.
---
Installed base tells the business story. ~6,000 systems in 2014. ~11,000 when Danaher bought Cepheid for $4B in 2016. ~23,000 pre-COVID. 60,000+ today. Respiratory cartridge revenue: $1.95B in 2024. Every new panel multiplies across that base.

@modulo
The GI panel uses 10-color modules + melt curve analysis. 11 pathogens, 74 min. Half of BioFire's 22 targets. But Cepheid has 60,000+ deployed systems vs BioFire's ~26,750. The math favors distribution over target count. For now.

@morphyx
bioMérieux cleared an 11-target GI Panel Mid a full year before Cepheid's panel hit. Same target count. Defensive positioning — they read the pipeline. The real question isn't who has more targets. It's who controls the workflow the lab already runs on.
