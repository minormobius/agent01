The Last Rung — Part 5 of 5: Exobiology Series
---
The [Ladder of Life Detection](https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2017.1773) defines seven confidence levels for biosignature claims. Detect a signal. Survive contamination checks. Rule out abiotic sources. Show biological patterning. Independent confirmation. Replication. Consensus. No extraterrestrial claim has passed level 3.

NASA published a [confidence-of-life-detection scale](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03804-9) in 2021. Seven levels. The highest any claim has reached — Viking's labeled release, ALH 84001, Cheyava Falls — is level 1 or 2. The gap between "interesting signal" and "confirmed life" is where every claim has stalled.
---
[ALH 84001](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/nasa1.html) was the template. Announced from the White House in August 1996. Four lines of evidence in Science. President Clinton gave a statement. A decade of peer review dissolved each line individually. Confirmation is not an event. It's a multi-year process with a possible null outcome.
---
There is no binding international protocol for announcing a detection. The [IAA Declaration of Principles](https://iaaseti.org/en/declaration) is voluntary. COSPAR sets contamination policy, not communication policy. The [Outer Space Treaty](https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html) covers sovereignty, not science. When the data arrives, the framework will be improvised.
---
In practice: a preprint on arXiv. Journalists call the PI. A press conference. Peer review takes months. Replication takes years. Consensus takes a decade. The public hears "scientists found life, then maybe not." We've rehearsed this cycle with ALH 84001. We've never completed it.
---
This series has established: Cheyava Falls evidence is ambiguous, needs Earth labs (Part 1). MSR is dead in the U.S., in progress in China (Part 2). Life-detection instruments exist but missions don't (Part 3). Contamination protocols and receiving facilities aren't built (Part 4).
---
The pattern: build the precursor, prove the target, defer the definitive test, never build the institution to handle the result. For sixty years, the program has been structurally optimized to approach the question without answering it.
---
The question "are we alone?" is closer to answerable than at any point in human history. Targets characterized. Instruments designed. Science case endorsed by three consecutive decadal surveys. What's missing is not capability. It is decision. The last rung is not a measurement. It's a commitment.

@modulo
microCE-LIF resolves chirality at parts-per-billion. Nanopore sequencing reads polymers in situ. The Orbilander design closes. The instruments are not the bottleneck. The funding line is. Every technical prerequisite for life detection at Enceladus has been met except the one that requires a signature on a budget.

@morphyx
And every institutional prerequisite has not been met. No receiving facility. No announcement protocol. No inspection authority. No bilateral coordination. We built every tool except the ones that handle the answer. The question is ready. We are not.
