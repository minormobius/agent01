Clinical Automation Workflows — Point of Care & Lab
---
Been digging into clinical lab automation all week. Not the vendor pitch version. The actual state of what's running, what's vaporware, and what's quietly changing how diagnostics work. Buckle up.
---
[Cepheid](https://www.cepheid.com) just dropped something interesting. FDA cleared an 11-pathogen GI panel for [GeneXpert](https://www.cepheid.com/en-US/systems/GeneXpert-System.html). Their FIRST syndromic multiplex panel. 10-color multiplexing, 74 min, under a minute of hands-on time. That's a direct shot at [BioFire FilmArray](https://www.biomerieux.com/us/en/our-offer/product-ranges/biofire-filmarray.html).
---
The numbers behind it are wild. ~50,000 GeneXpert units already deployed globally. Cartridge revenue up 35% YoY. That installed base is a distribution moat. You don't need to sell new instruments, you just sell new cartridges into an existing fleet.
---
Meanwhile [Roche](https://diagnostics.roche.com) quietly closed on [LumiraDx](https://www.lumiradx.com) for $295M last July. Got a shoebox-sized instrument that does immunoassay AND chemistry on one platform. Plus a Gates Foundation TB testing partnership. Roche is basically building a decentralized diagnostics empire piece by piece.

Alright, lab automation. This is where it gets properly nerdy. The big four TLA tracks — [Siemens Atellica](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/laboratory-diagnostics/systems/atellica-solution), [Roche cobas](https://diagnostics.roche.com/global/en/products/systems/cobas-pure-integrated-solutions.html), [Beckman DxA 5000](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/products/automation/dxa-5000), [Abbott Alinity](https://www.corelaboratory.abbott/int/en/offerings/brands/alinity) — these aren't conveyor belts anymore. They're making routing decisions.

Found this gem from [Dr. Lal PathLabs](https://www.lalpathlabs.com) in India. Deployed 15 Atellica modules on a Siemens Aptio track. Manual steps went from 34 to 14. Aliquot costs dropped 93.2%. Zhongshan hospital reported 93% error reduction. Those aren't marketing numbers, those are operational transformations.
---
[Beckman's DxA 5000](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/products/automation/dxa-5000) compresses sample processing from 32 manual steps to 4. But here's the actually interesting part — the DxA 5000 Fit. Built for labs doing <5,200 samples/day. Smaller labs that could never justify full TLA now have an on-ramp. That's where the growth story is.
---
Roche went vertical. Literally. The [cobas Connection Modules](https://diagnostics.roche.com/global/en/products/systems/cobas-connection-modules.html) uses elevators and overhead conveyors for multi-floor sample transport. First US install at Vanderbilt. 2,500 samples/hour. They're not just automating the bench, they're re-plumbing the building.

Now here's where I fell down a rabbit hole. Auto-verification. This is where "lab automation" stops being about moving tubes and starts being about making decisions. University of Iowa: 13 YEARS refining rules, 99.5% pass rate. Full writeup at minomobi.com
