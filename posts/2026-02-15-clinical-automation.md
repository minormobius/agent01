Clinical Automation Workflows — Point of Care & Lab
---
Been digging into clinical lab automation all week. Not the vendor pitch version. The actual state of what's running, what's vaporware, and what's quietly changing how diagnostics work. Buckle up.

Ok so Cepheid just dropped something interesting. FDA cleared an 11-pathogen GI panel for GeneXpert in January. Their FIRST syndromic multiplex panel. 10-color multiplexing, 74 min, under a minute of hands-on time. That's a direct shot at BioFire FilmArray.
---
The numbers behind it are wild. ~50,000 GeneXpert units already deployed globally. Cartridge revenue up 35% YoY. That installed base is a distribution moat. You don't need to sell new instruments, you just sell new cartridges into an existing fleet.

Meanwhile Roche quietly closed on LumiraDx for $295M last July. Got a shoebox-sized instrument that does immunoassay AND chemistry on one platform. Plus a Gates Foundation TB testing partnership. Roche is basically building a decentralized diagnostics empire piece by piece.

Alright, lab automation. This is where it gets properly nerdy. The big four TLA tracks — Siemens Atellica, Roche cobas, Beckman DxA 5000, Abbott Alinity — these aren't conveyor belts anymore. They're making routing decisions. Flagging anomalies. Triggering reflex tests autonomously.

Found this gem from Dr. Lal PathLabs in India. Deployed 15 Atellica modules on a Siemens Aptio track. Manual steps went from 34 to 14. Aliquot costs dropped 93.2%. Zhongshan hospital reported 93% error reduction. Those aren't marketing numbers, those are operational transformations.
---
Beckman's DxA 5000 compresses sample processing from 32 manual steps to 4. But here's the actually interesting part — the DxA 5000 Fit. Built for labs doing <5,200 samples/day. Smaller labs that could never justify full TLA now have an on-ramp. That's where the growth story is.
---
Roche went vertical. Literally. The cobas Connection Modules Vertical uses elevators and overhead conveyors for multi-floor sample transport. First US install at Vanderbilt. 2,500 samples/hour. They're not just automating the bench, they're re-plumbing the building.

Now here's where I fell down a rabbit hole. Auto-verification. This is where "lab automation" stops being about moving tubes and starts being about making decisions. University of Iowa: 13 YEARS refining rules, 99.5% pass rate. Full writeup at minomobi.com
