Clinical Automation Workflows — Point of Care & Lab
---
Thread: The clinical lab is being quietly rewired. Not by a single breakthrough, but by incremental automation eating workflow after workflow. Here's what's actually shipping vs. what's still a conference slide. 🧵
---
POINT OF CARE: Cepheid just got FDA clearance (Jan 2026) for an 11-pathogen GI panel on GeneXpert — their first highly multiplexed syndromic panel. <1 min hands-on time, ~74 min to result. This puts them in direct competition with BioFire FilmArray.
---
Cepheid's cartridge revenue is growing 35% YoY with ~50,000 GeneXpert units deployed globally. Meanwhile Roche acquired LumiraDx's POC tech for $295M in July 2024 — a shoebox-sized instrument consolidating immunoassay + chemistry on one platform.
---
LAB AUTOMATION: The big four TLA platforms (Siemens Atellica, Roche cobas, Beckman DxA 5000, Abbott Alinity) now do more than move tubes. Siemens claims their Atellica Integrated Automation reduces manual workflow steps by 75% and consolidates 25 manual tasks.
---
Beckman's DxA 5000 cuts sample processing from 32 manual steps to 4. Their new DxA 5000 Fit targets labs under 5,200 samples/day — eliminating up to 80% of manual steps for smaller operations that couldn't justify full TLA before.
---
Roche launched the cobas Connection Modules Vertical — elevator and overhead conveyor for multi-floor sample transport. First US install at Vanderbilt. Handles 2,500 samples/hour. The physical infrastructure of labs is literally being rebuilt.
---
AUTO-VERIFICATION is where "automation" gets real. Mature systems hit 95%+ auto-verification rates in core chemistry. University of Iowa refined theirs over 13 years to 99.5%. But here's the catch: rules are lab-specific. No universal rule sets exist.
---
CAP has documented cases where identical samples through the same middleware at different sites produce different results — because auto-verification rules differ. Multi-site harmonization is a genuinely unsolved problem.
---
AI IN DIAGNOSTICS: 1,356 FDA-authorized AI/ML devices as of Sept 2025, with 295 cleared in 2025 alone — a record. But 77% are radiology. And the dirty secret: only 2 CPT reimbursement codes exist for AI diagnostics. No billing code, no adoption.
---
DIGITAL PATHOLOGY is consolidating fast. Tempus acquired Paige AI for just $81.25M (Aug 2025) — gaining 7M digitized pathology slides. PathAI got FDA clearance for AISight Dx with a rare Predetermined Change Control Plan, letting them update the AI post-clearance.
---
THE SKEPTIC'S VIEW: "Lights-out lab" is a conference slide, not reality. No clinical lab runs fully autonomously. Of 717 radiology AI devices studied, only 5% underwent prospective testing and only 8% included human-in-the-loop evaluation.
---
The workforce crisis is real though: 28% of lab workers over 50 plan to retire within 3-5 years. Vacancy rates hit 7-11% nationally, 25% in some regions. Automation isn't optional — it's a staffing survival strategy.
---
BOTTOM LINE: Core chemistry and pre-analytical sorting are nearest to "lights-out." Surgical pathology, complex microbiology, and flow cytometry are furthest. The real story isn't AI replacing humans — it's automation filling seats that can't be hired for.
