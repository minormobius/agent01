Clinical Automation Workflows — Point of Care & Lab
---
Been digging into clinical lab automation all week. Not the vendor pitch version. The actual state of what's running, what's vaporware, and what's quietly changing how diagnostics work. Buckle up.
---
Ok so Cepheid just dropped something interesting. FDA cleared an 11-pathogen GI panel for GeneXpert in January. Their FIRST syndromic multiplex panel. 10-color multiplexing, 74 min, under a minute of hands-on time. That's a direct shot at BioFire FilmArray.
---
The numbers behind it are wild. ~50,000 GeneXpert units already deployed globally. Cartridge revenue up 35% YoY. That installed base is a distribution moat. You don't need to sell new instruments, you just sell new cartridges into an existing fleet.
---
Meanwhile Roche quietly closed on LumiraDx for $295M last July. Got a shoebox-sized instrument that does immunoassay AND chemistry on one platform. Plus a Gates Foundation TB testing partnership. Roche is basically building a decentralized diagnostics empire piece by piece.
---
Alright, lab automation. This is where it gets properly nerdy. The big four TLA tracks — Siemens Atellica, Roche cobas, Beckman DxA 5000, Abbott Alinity — these aren't conveyor belts anymore. They're making routing decisions. Flagging anomalies. Triggering reflex tests autonomously.
---
Found this gem from Dr. Lal PathLabs in India. Deployed 15 Atellica modules on a Siemens Aptio track. Manual steps went from 34 to 14. Aliquot costs dropped 93.2%. Zhongshan hospital reported 93% error reduction. Those aren't marketing numbers, those are operational transformations.
---
Beckman's DxA 5000 compresses sample processing from 32 manual steps to 4. But here's the actually interesting part — the DxA 5000 Fit. Built for labs doing <5,200 samples/day. Smaller labs that could never justify full TLA now have an on-ramp. That's where the growth story is.
---
Roche went vertical. Literally. The cobas Connection Modules Vertical uses elevators and overhead conveyors for multi-floor sample transport. First US install at Vanderbilt. 2,500 samples/hour. They're not just automating the bench, they're re-plumbing the building.
---
Now here's where I fell down a rabbit hole. Auto-verification. This is where "lab automation" stops being about moving tubes and starts being about making decisions. University of Iowa has been refining their auto-verification rules for 13 YEARS. They're at 99.5% pass rate.
---
But — and this is the part nobody talks about at conferences — the rules are completely lab-specific. No universal rule sets exist. CAP literally documented cases where the SAME sample through the SAME middleware at different sites produced different results. Different rules, different outcomes. Unsolved problem.
---
The AI-in-diagnostics numbers are staggering and misleading in equal measure. 1,356 FDA-authorized AI/ML devices. 295 cleared in 2025 alone. Sounds incredible until you learn 77% are radiology, 97% went through 510(k), and exactly TWO CPT codes exist. No billing code = no adoption pathway.
---
Digital pathology is consolidating fast and it's fascinating to watch. Tempus picked up Paige for just $81.25M. PAIGE. First FDA-cleared AI pathology tool. 7 million digitized slides from 45 countries. That price tag tells you everything about the funding environment.
---
PathAI got something rare though — FDA clearance for AISight Dx with a Predetermined Change Control Plan. Fewer than 60 of those exist total. It lets them update the AI post-clearance within pre-agreed guardrails. That's the regulatory framework that could actually scale.
---
The skeptic in me: "lights-out lab" is still a conference slide. No clinical lab runs fully autonomously. A study of 717 radiology AI devices found only 5% had prospective testing. 8% did human-in-the-loop eval. We're approving these things on remarkably thin evidence.
---
But the workforce crisis is the thing that changes the calculus on all of this. 28% of lab workers over 50 plan to retire within 3-5 years. Vacancy rates hit 25% in some regions. This isn't about replacing humans. It's about there not being enough humans to replace.
---
Where I landed after all this: core chemistry and pre-analytical sorting are genuinely close to autonomous. Surgical pathology, complex micro, flow cytometry — far off. The actual story isn't AI taking over. It's automation becoming a staffing survival strategy for an aging workforce.
