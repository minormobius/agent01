> FULL onedoor certificate survives untouched on every seed tested: **K(6,8) = 48/48, 14/14 spirals continuous,
> every door at grade, one-door** (pinned). The seven child hexagons persist as **DISTRICTS**: a true 7-way Voronoi

> `placeDoors` picks each K-pair's door independently, and at ×7 two pairs can land on the SAME chamber — a cell
> can only be one door first-person, so `officeweave.dedupeDoors` relocates the collider to the next-flattest
> adjacency of the same two threads (the certificate's own doors are untouched). **(2) Hew to hoop/v101.** The
> office partition adopts the v101 room programme (vendored policy `v101/rooms.js` — see `v101/VENDOR.md`):
> **traffic-sized rooms** (zone weights = `TRAFFIC_FOOTPRINT`, so civic hubs claim more chambers than dwellings —
> measured and pinned), a **grand anchor** at the nexus end (GRAND role on whites, the engine core on production),
> **MIN_ROOM bulldozing**, and the v101 world-painter read: the hallway spine is carved out as the HALL, every
> room boundary is a **wall** except **one lit threshold per room** (a spanning tree of the region graph rooted at
> the hall — walls are the default, doors are deliberately-placed gaps), light **pools per room** from a
> self-emitting component (+ warm bollards along the hall), and residents walk at half scale with boids
> separation. Movement respects the walls (`passable()` is the walk graph; reachability of every chamber from the

> **LINE OF SIGHT (the third move — the portal mechanic is retired).** The map is what you can SEE. Every thread
> renders in its owning hue (solid, persistent, bending out); the walls carry **real gaps** at every door, and the
> kernel rasterises those same trimmed walls into an **occlusion grid** (`buildSight`) — so sight rays pass through
> the doorways and the thread beyond **spills into view** in its own colour, more of it as you approach. **Crossing
> is a no-op**: one global walk graph (`buildGlobalWalk` — office walls + the 48 K-doors + the open plazas) means
> walking through a door is just walking; "which thread am I on" = who owns the chamber underfoot. What you leave
> **fades out behind you** (visibility decays toward line-of-sight; no memory, no minimap — remembering the plan
> would tangle the levels). Sight is **level-local**: the plan interleaves both strata, so (a) the floor tiles are
> the 2D Voronoi of each cell against its LEVEL-MATES only (|Δz| < 2.2 decks — tiling against everything shreds
> each level into a sponge, measured median flank Δz ≈ 2.8 decks), (b) an edge is only a wall when its flanks abut
> on one level, (c) the occlusion is TWO grids (upper/lower stratum; near-grade walls stamp both), and (d) the
> renderer hides cells outside your walkable z-window — the other-parity threads pass above and below unseen and
> surface exactly where the weave brings them to grade, which is where the doors are. **The plazas are the
> exception that proves onedoor**: the flat core is the certified door-free concourse, so it carries NO walls at
> all and its level is your KIND — the six white threads visibly share one open lobby floor (walk from any white
> onto any other; the engine plaza mirrors it below). The hub is no longer a synthetic portal room — it is a place.
> All pinned: global reach of every owned chamber, both concourses joined with zero K-doors and zero cross-kind

> walls (thin stone with real body, door gaps intact), graded floor darts from a global position-hashed lattice
> (seamless across chunks), door-bridge nuclei — then `bakeChunk` splats an OCCLUDED light field through the same
> tiling (v5/lights) and paints every tile albedo × light. **Albedo is the THREAD's hue — solid threads survive; the
> ROLE enters through the light** (wall lamps + components are tinted by room role, so a govern room reads as indigo
> lamplight pooling on schedule-blue floor). Rooms carry v101 furniture: a superformula deco COMPONENT
> (`v5/deco.deviceGenome`, luminescence derived from its construction), 1–2 grown WALL LAMPS (sconce/coral/crystal),
> and a voronoi-grown WALL FIXTURE (`consoles.growWallFixtures` — claims the room's own tiles, corner-anchored,
> door-clear, gold-seamed, its crown lit by the bake). Residents are v101 SPRITE PEOPLE (the already-vendored

> **THE POCKET DIMENSION (`pocket.html` · kernel `pocketweave.js`, proof `test/pocket.selftest.mjs`).** The honest
> cheat: true metric scale was never load-bearing, so each thread becomes a POCKET — a nave-scale strip floor solved
> by the v100 rooms-and-concourse engine and painted by the VERBATIM vendored `v101/skin.js#paintChunk` (the full
> skin the foam could never feed). The TOPOLOGY is exact and purely analytic (no foam needed — `buildGeometry` +
> `weaveLines` only, ~ms): every K(6,8) crossing is a STATION solved in closed form (`solveStations`) with an exact
> rf, over/under parity (which wall the door is on) and district (arches along the strip); doors sit in TRUE-ARC
> order; crossing lands you at the RECIPROCAL station and crossing back returns you (involution, pinned). The hub
> ends attach to two COMMONS pockets (the nave pattern) so the plazas stay walked; one-door survives by
> construction. Walking/fog/pathing are v100's own kit (`buildWalk`/`pathFind`/`sightBall` — vision flows the
> concourse and through doors); residents are sprite people on the walk graph. **THE CHUNKS**: a thread is NOT one
> monolithic solve — its spine is cut into 2–5 SEGMENTS (cuts snapped away from station alcoves), each solved
> lazily as its own v100 chunk, but all sharing ONE `foamSeed` per thread so they slice the SAME global 3D Voronoi
> foam: seams abut bit-identically (v101's voronoi-continuity discipline, applied to the faux threads). Each cut
> carries one SEAM PORT at the spine point, `inherit`-ed by both sides, so the concourses meet across the seam
> (a bulkhead doorway) and the walk stitches via `extendWalk`. Door placement is SEGMENT-LOCAL (anchored at the
> hub end or the seam port) and therefore solve-order independent — a pocket first touched via its middle segment
> (a door preview) places the same doors as one solved hub → rim; pinned. The page streams accordingly: enter a

> **THE ONE-DOOR RESOLUTION (`onedoor.html` · `rind.mino.mobi/ops/onedoor.html`; kernel `onedoor.js`, proof
> `test/onedoor.selftest.mjs`).** The hard spec line — *wayfinding from ANY point in the chunk to ANY other point
> passes through only ONE door, including the two central hubs* — is now true **by construction and proven**, not
> "≈ one door". Why it was stuck: the per-thread door graph (`cells3d.routeMinDoors`) counts a door as *crossing
> into a different **thread***, and the 6 white arms all spiral the same way out of the top hub so **no white arm
> ever crosses another white arm** — white·i → white·j shares no door and must detour through a production arm (2
> doors); same for the 8 production arms; the interstitial matrix is a third region on top. So same-colour trips
> cost ≥2 and the honest max was up to 4. It's a property of how doors are **counted**, not of the geometry.
> **The fix collapses the walkable space to exactly TWO door-free concourses joined only by controlled doors:** the
> WHITE concourse = the 6 arms **+ the nave (top) hub**, ONE connected door-free region (open plates throughout);
> the PRODUCTION concourse = the 8 arms + the bottom hub, ONE connected door-free region on the floor stratum; and
> **the only doors in the whole chunk are the 48 K(6,8) crossings**, each a single **zero-grade** doorway at the
> flat the weave already lands there — every other white/production plate is a **wall** (the rind rule: walls are
> the default, doors are deliberately-placed gaps). Then within a colour → **0 doors**, across colours → **exactly
> 1** (walk your concourse free to the nearest crossing, cross once, walk free), so **max over ALL pairs, incl. both
> hubs, = 1** — the structural proof (two 0-connected regions + ≥1 door ⇒ max 1) *and* an exhaustive-ish measurement
> agree, pinned across seeds/widths/chunks. The "6 arms / 8 arms" survive as a wayfinding **identity overlay** (which
> arm tours which engines — the tour is unchanged), not as walls. **How it's built** (`onedoor.js`): (a)
> `assignConcourses` hard-binds every ARM-owned cell to its colour — so NO K crossing is ever lost — and floods only
> the interstitial matrix to the nearest colour, which stitches the same-colour arms into one component through their
> hub; (b) `placeDoors` opens, per (w,f), the single flattest white-w↔prod-f adjacency (the zero-grade doorway); (c)
> `certify` proves whiteConnected ∧ prodConnected ∧ maxDoors===1 ∧ hubs-one-door. **Honest tensions kept raw:**
> K lands **~44–48/48** (a few crossings have no adjacency — widen / add decks) and a handful of doors are genuine
> over/under **stairs** rather than zero-grade (drawn dashed-red) — these are QUALITY metrics, reported but *not*
> part of the one-door proof, which holds no matter how many of the 48 a seed opens. The next lever, if we want
> 48/48 truly at grade, is a **meet-at-grade weave** (both threads pass through mid-height with a flat at each

> **TWO SUBSTRATES (the `▦ HCP / ✳ on-curve` toggle · kernel `curveseed.js`).** The one-door tech is substrate-

> On-curve is the more curve-native substrate and lands the spec *better*: because a nucleus sits on its thread, it
> realises the **full K(6,8) = 48/48** and **every door is zero-grade** on every seed (the crossings are on the
> curves, not a deck apart). The catch it exposed — and the general lesson — is that **nearest-curve ownership
> fragments**: the over/under weave chops each thread into Voronoi islands at its crossings, so hard-binding those
> owners gives dozens of concourse pieces, not one. Two fixes make it whole: **(1)** concourses are assigned by a
> **geodesic flood from the two hubs** (`assignConcoursesFlood` — a Dijkstra forest from a connected seed is
> connected by construction, so each concourse is ONE region on any substrate), and **(2)** the sparse filler +
> an orphan-**stitch** pass (buildCells' 0.5 face tolerance drops a few genuine faces, leaving degree-0 slivers and
> small floating clusters — `stitchComponents` links every offcut to its nearest cell so the foam is one connected
> solid). With both, the on-curve substrate is provably one-door (pinned in `onedoor.selftest.mjs` over 6 seeds:
> K=48/48, all doors at grade, both concourses one region, max = 1). `filler: 0` is the instructive pure-curve case:
> K=48 and 100% fill but the concourses fragment and one-door FAILS — the interstitial filler is what bridges the
> crossing-chopped pieces back together. On-curve is the **default** view; a `〜 curves` overlay draws the 14 analytic

> **PER-SPIRAL VORONOI CONTINUITY — the core requirement, and it's an OWNERSHIP property, not a seeding or room one

> **THE ZERO-LADDER 6×8 (the `breathe` lever = `turnScale`).** The last residue was ~2–3 K-doors landing as over/under

> mid-height ⇒ they meet side-by-side, a walkable wall, instead of stacking): **(a) fewer threads** — ≤ 4×4 hits
> steep=0 with full K; and **(b) loosening the spirals at the FULL 6×8** — `turnScale ~0.35` (fewer turns spreads the
> crossings radially; "let the tight curves breathe — it's an infinite world"). At `turnScale ≤ 0.35`, 6×8 is a TRUE
> zero-ladder world on every seed: **every one of the 48 doors at grade, full K(6,8)=48, every spiral continuous, one
> door** — all at once (pinned in `onedoor.selftest.mjs`; the onedoor view defaults to `breathe 0.35` with a

## The problem

The rind's production floor is **autonomic** — eight engines run lights-out:

> **foundry · chemworks · mill · fab · weave · assembly · fluid · reclaim** (8 surfaces)

Over them sits the **ops cortex** — six white-collar surfaces that watch and steer the floor:

> **perfusion · dispatch · scheduling · gate · telemetry · inventory** (6 surfaces)

The requirement: **every white-collar surface must reach every production surface.** The user wants the
visitor to **enter at a single point**, step onto **one of the six** white surfaces, and from that surface's
point of view **tour all eight** engines — and the whole thing to read as a **tangled-up mess**, laid out in
just **2–3 map floors**.

## The diagnosis: why the gyroid didn't make it

The earlier proto (`hoop/forge/micro.js`, the `/forge/micro` page) modelled this as a **gyroid**: two broad
woven **sheets** — one "white-collar", one "material" — crossing over-under a quarter-wave out of phase, with
a facility at every crossing, claiming *every office touches every facility*.

It's a pretty picture but it answers the wrong question. A gyroid is the **two-phase** triply-periodic minimal
surface. To use it here you have to **collapse all six white surfaces into one sheet** and **all eight engines
into one sheet**. Then "contact" is true by area — and, in the code, literally by fiat:

```js
const whiteTouches = facilities.map(() => true);   // micro.js:90 — asserted, not derived
```

Two fatal consequences:

1. **No identity ⇒ no tour.** Once the six are one sheet, there is no "white surface 3" to follow. The
   user's core ask — *tour the eight from one surface's point of view* — is unrepresentable. A gyroid gives
   contact-as-**area**; the tour needs contact-as-**path**.
2. **The material analogy points the other way.** A gyroid is what **two** components do (block-copolymer
   microphase separation, lamellar↔gyroid). We don't have two components — we have **fourteen** surfaces that
   must mutually touch. The many-component version of "interpenetrating phases that all stay in contact" is
   not a minimal surface. It's **a woven textile.**

## The reframe: it's a graph, and the graph is K(6,8)

Strip the geometry and the requirement is exactly one object: the **complete bipartite graph K(6,8)** — six
vertices on one side, eight on the other, **every** white joined to **every** prod. 6·8 = **48 edges**.

Two facts about K(6,8) decide the whole design:

- **It is non-planar.** It contains K(3,3) (the utilities-puzzle graph) many times over, so its 48 contacts
  **cannot** be drawn on one floor without crossings. The "tangled-up mess" the user is hoping for is not a
  stylistic choice — it is **forced** by the graph.
- **Its genus is 6** (`⌈(6−2)(8−2)/4⌉ = 6`). Genus counts the handles a surface needs to embed the graph
  cleanly — i.e. how many times threads must dive past each other through the thickness. **The tangle *is* the
  genus.** Our job is to realise that genus as something a person can walk in 2–3 floors.

## The structure: a plain weave (a plaid), wrapped onto the cylinder

Keep all fourteen surfaces as distinct **threads** and weave them:

- **6 warp threads** = the white-collar tours (run *along* the tour direction)
- **8 weft threads** = the production lines (run *across*)

In a **plain weave**, every warp crosses every weft **exactly once**. Those **48 crossings are the 48 edges of
K(6,8)** — realised, not asserted. Each crossing is a **facility** where one white surface meets one engine
(the old "facility at every weave crossing", now honest). Over/under follows a checkerboard — *warp over weft
iff (w+f) is even* — which **alternates along every warp and every weft**: a genuine plain weave, **two
interpenetrating layers** ("broad, not deep" — the gyroid's one true virtue, kept).

### The tour falls straight out

Follow **one warp thread** and you pass through **all eight wefts in order** — meeting each engine once,
over-under-over. That **is** "enter one white surface, tour the eight engines from its point of view." The
itinerary for warp *w* is the cyclic order `[(w+0), (w+1), … (w+7)] mod 8` — row *w* of a **Latin rectangle**
(shifts of ℤ/8). Because the six offsets are distinct, at **every** tour step the six whites occupy six
**different** engines: the six tours are **conflict-free** (no two whites at the same engine at the same step)
yet fully interleaved.

### Wrapped onto the rind, it's a braid

The rind is an O'Neill **cylinder**. Wrap the plaid onto it: the **8 wefts become 8 azimuthal stations** (a
ring — the same azimuthal layout as the zoom viewer and `/forge/ship`), and the **6 warps become helices**,
all leaving the **single entry** on the nave side and wound at six different phase offsets. Six strands round
an eight-station ring, phase-shifted = a **6-strand braid** — the tangle, made of distinct followable threads.
The radial thickness the helices wind through is only a few cells: the **2–3 floors**.

## What the kernel guarantees (proven, in `test/weave.selftest.mjs`)

| Claim | How it's checked |
|---|---|
| **48 contacts, complete** | the incidence matrix is rebuilt from the crossing set and confirmed all-ones |
| **every white tours every prod** | each warp's itinerary is a permutation of all 8 |
| **conflict-free schedule** | at each of the 8 steps the 6 warps sit on 6 distinct engines |
| **genuine plain weave** | over/under alternates along every warp *and* every weft; each warp is over 4 / under 4 |
| **single entry → 6** | 6 helices, 6 distinct phase offsets (a braid, not a parallel cable) |
| **real tangle** | each helix crosses all 8 rings (48 total) and passes front↔back of the tube |
| **deterministic** | identical from the seed (atproto/permalink-stable, like every rind kernel) |

Contrast the gyroid's `contact()`, which returned a hardcoded `true`. Here completeness is **derived from the
crossings themselves**, so the theory is the thing the test pins.

## How the cells tessellate (`tess.html` · the honeycomb)

One weave-cell is a **hexagon** — `foam3d`'s `rings` cuts it into a **centered-hexagonal number** of chunks
(`chunkCount(rings) = 3n²+3n+1`: **1 · 7 · 19 · 37 · 61 …**; the `⬡ chunks` button cycles 7/19/37). Hexagons
**honeycomb**, so the cells tile the rind shell. The interesting part is the *coupling*, and it falls out of a
coincidence that isn't one:

- **A hexagon has exactly 6 neighbours. The cortex has exactly 6 white arms.** So **each white arm is aimed at
  one neighbour** — white arm *k* exits cell A through edge *k* and hands off to cell B. The **white weave is the
  connective tissue** of the lattice; a white role threads engines across many cells, not just its own.
- **The 8 production engines don't divide a hexagon's 6-fold symmetry, so they stay LOCAL** — each cell's own
  machinery, its own lower hub. *The floor is islands; the cortex is the sea.* This is also the right semantics:
  ops surfaces (dispatch, scheduling, telemetry…) are exactly the things that coordinate *across* production
  blocks; the engines are local plant. The 6-vs-8 mismatch that forced K(6,8) non-planar is the same mismatch
  that decides what tiles (the 6) and what doesn't (the 8).
- **What couples across an edge:** white arm *k* of A reaches into B, where it can touch B's 8 engines — so A's
  whites tour B's engines too. **K(6,8) per cell, plus white→engine reach across every shared edge**; the global
  fabric is one connected cortex over a field of production islands.
- **Self-similar (aperture-7).** Seven cells make a bigger hex-flower rotated ≈19.106° — the **same aperture-7
  nesting Uber's H3** uses to tile the globe. So the weave nests: 7 ops-cells → a district, 7 districts → a
  region, at every scale the same K(6,8) motif.
- **On the cylinder.** Honeycomb the plane, then wrap it with an **integer azimuthal period** and the tiling
  closes around the rind's spin while staying unbounded along the axis.

**Design implication (not yet in the 3D kernel):** to actually hand off, a cell's 6 white arms should terminate
at the **6 hexagon edge-midpoints** (pinned rim-exits), not at spiral-arbitrary angles. `tess.html` draws the
idealised honeycomb with that pinning; folding it back into `foam3d` (anchor each white arm's rim-exit to its
edge, then stitch neighbour hubs) is the next build if we want the lattice to be navigable end-to-end.

## Open questions (the next turn of theory)

- **Is the cyclic Latin rectangle the right schedule**, or do we want a more scrambled (less regular) weave to
  read as *more* of a mess? The cyclic shift is the most legible tangle — each thread is "always advance one
  station". A twill or a random derangement would tangle harder at the cost of followability.
- **2 floors vs 3.** A plain weave is 2 layers. The third "floor" is the radial gap the braid descends
  through (office band → weave floor → lower-rind portal, the `micro.js` gradient). Do we keep the portal as a
  distinct third deck, or fold it into the weave?
- **The wefts aren't symmetric.** reclaim feeds the front of the chain and assembly feeds the nave; a real
  layout might *order* the ring by the production DAG rather than treat the 8 as interchangeable. That turns
  the plaid into a weave with a grain.
