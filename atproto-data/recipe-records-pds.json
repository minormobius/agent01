Add them to a mixing bowl. Make sure there is no excess moisture in your chicken. If you want you may pat dry with a few kitchen tissues.","Add red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, salt, lemon juice, oil, ginger garlic paste, yogurt and kasuri methi. Skip the lemon juice if your yogurt is sour.","Mix well. Cover with a cling wrap and refrigerate for minimum of 8 hours and up to 48 hours. If you are in a rush, you may cut down to 3 hours.","## Tikka Sauce","Heat oil or ghee in a pot or pan. Add onions and sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt. Saute until deep golden.","Add ginger garlic paste and green chilli. Saute until aromatic, for 40 to 60 seconds.","Reduce the heat to low. Add red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala and cumin powder. Stir well quickly.","Add the tomatoes and cook on a medium high heat until the onion tomato masala becomes really thick.

Simmer until thick, for about 12 to 14 mins.","**Optional** – Cool down and blend to a smooth puree. Return it to the pot and heat up. This step cuts down the acidity from canned tomatoes.","## Chicken","Thread on skewers and place them in the basket or in the tray. Air fry for 6 mins, at 400 F or 200 C. Turn them with tongs and air fry for another 6 mins. If they dry out, you may baste with marinade and continue for another 2 mins, until slightly charred.","After 12 to 14 mins of simmering the tikka masala sauce, add sugar and the cream (or cashew cream, check notes to make your own). Stir well and cook for a few minutes until thick, creamy and aromatic. (Check video for consistency)","Add the chicken tikka and crushed kasuri methi. (Make sure your gravy has reached a thick gravy consistency/serving consistency, before adding chicken). Stir and cook for 2 to 3 mins until chicken tikka is soft and tender.
