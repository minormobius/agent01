# mino OS (`os/`) — Capabilities & Architecture

**Canonical overview.** What `os/` is, what it can do today, how it's wired, and
where it's going. This is the map; the two deep-dives below are the territory.

| Doc | Role |

| **`CAPABILITIES.md`** (this) | Vision, capability matrix, architecture-at-a-glance, deployment state, roadmap. Start here. |
| **`DESIGN.md`** | Feature/how-it-works reference — every shell command, the CAR parser, DuckDB integration, container internals. |
| **`api/SECURITY.md`** | Trust model — why no secret is safe in the container, the capability-token primitive, the per-tenant credential plan. |

## What this is

An **ATProto-native browser workspace**: a terminal (`os.mino.mobi`) that treats
your Personal Data Server as a filesystem, layers SQL analytics over your whole
repo, and — for trusted users — drops you into a **real cloud shell with Claude
Code** that operates on your behalf. The repo *is* the backend; Cloudflare is
glue. The product thesis: your identity (a DID + PDS session) is the only account
you need — every capability hangs off that one verified identity.

It runs in **three planes**:

```

## Capability matrix

Legend: ✅ live · 🚧 built, not yet deployed · 📋 planned

### Identity & auth
| Capability | Where | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ATProto app-password login | browser → PDS | ✅ | `auth/oauth.js`: handle→DID→PDS, `createSession`. Phase-2 OAuth (PKCE+DPoP) is stubbed. |
| Google OAuth (for Gemini) | browser | ✅ | `auth/google.js`: popup, implicit grant, scope `generative-language`. Powers the `ai` command with no API key. |
| Anthropic key for container | browser localStorage | ✅ | `set-key` / `container --api-key=`. Used by Claude Code in the shell. |
| Container access allowlist | worker | ✅ | `ALLOWED_DIDS`, **fail-closed**. Identity is *verified* (DID→canonical PDS→`getSession`), never trusted from the client. |

### Browser PDS shell (no backend — direct XRPC)
| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Repo-as-filesystem: `ls cd cat echo edit rm find du whoami` | ✅ | Each maps to an XRPC call against the user's PDS. `echo '{}' > path` / `edit` write records. |
| `blob ls/get/push` | ✅ | Blob management via `com.atproto.sync` / `repo.uploadBlob`. |
| `curl <nsid>` | ✅ | Raw XRPC escape hatch. |
| `find -text "term"` | ✅ | Full-text walk across all collections. |

### Data / analytics (client-side, zero backend)
| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sync` — full repo → CAR → records | ✅ | `com.atproto.sync.getRepo` → **Rust/WASM** CAR v1 + DAG-CBOR + CID + MST parser (`crates/car-parser`, ~116KB) → NDJSON. |
| `sync --stats` | ✅ | Collection counts without full ingest. |
| `sql <query>` | ✅ | **DuckDB-Wasm** over the synced `records` table. JSON extraction, aggregation, the works. |
| `ai <prompt>` | ✅ | Gemini, browser-side (`lib/gemini.js`). |

### Container shell (plane 2+3)
| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Real bash PTY over WebSocket | 🚧 | Code complete (`api/`, PTY server in `container/`). Backend deploy is dispatch-only — see below. |
| Per-DID persistent workspace | 🚧 | R2 tarball restore on start + 2-min autosave; survives 10-min idle sleep. |
| Toolchain: git · node 22 · python3 · **uv** · claude-code | 🚧 | `container/Dockerfile`. uv added for fast Python installs (HTTPS, egress-safe). |
| GitHub MCP server | 🚧 | Installed in image; usable once backend is live + a git credential path exists (roadmap §4). |

### Control plane / security primitives
| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Per-instance capability token | ✅ | HMAC-signed `{did, exp}`, signing key worker-only. The primitive every privileged op hangs off. |
| `/sync` DID-scoping | ✅ | A container can touch only its own R2 workspace (`id === cap.did`). |
| Shared-cred tenancy switch | ✅ | `INJECT_SHARED_CREDS` gates `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. Default off. |
| PDS proxy (`/pds/*`) + in-container MCP | 📋 | The differentiated win — agent operates on the user's own PDS without the token entering the shell. |
| GitHub App git broker (`/git/*`) | 📋 | Worker mints ~1h per-repo installation tokens; container uses them over HTTPS via a credential helper. |

---

## Deployment & operational state

| Surface | Resource | Domain | Workflow | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Pages worker `os` | `os.mino.mobi` | `deploy-os.yml` (paths `os/**` **excl.** `os/api/**`) | ✅ **Live.** Fully functional standalone — login + all PDS-shell/analytics/AI commands work with no backend. |
| **Container backend** | Worker `os-mino-api` + Container + DO + R2 | `os-api.minomobi.com` | `deploy-os-api.yml` | 🚧 **Dispatch-only, not yet live.** Pending: enable CF Containers, set `CAP_SIGNING_KEY`, create R2 `os-workspace`, attach domain. |
| OCR (sibling crate) | Worker `ocr` | `ocr.mino.mobi` | `deploy-ocr.yml` | ✅ Live. `crates/codescan-ocr` → `ocr/wasm/`. Separate product, shares the repo. |

The `container` command is **gated off in the frontend** until `VITE_CONTAINER_API_URL`
is set at build time — so it reports "not configured" instead of dangling a dead
WebSocket while the backend is unshipped. Frontend and backend deploy
independently (the frontend workflow excludes `os/api/**`).

**Housekeeping:** an orphan `pds-os` worker should be deleted (golden-rule
hygiene — `os` owns `os.mino.mobi`).

---

## Security model (summary)

One invariant drives everything: **the user controls the container** (root shell,
`/proc/<pid>/mem`), so **no secret is safe inside it**. Secrets live only in the
worker; the container gets **capabilities, not credentials** via the did-scoped
`CAP_TOKEN`. Single-tenant may inject shared `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
(you trust yourself); multi-tenant must not — it hands a second user your whole
account. Full model, trust table, and the per-tenant credential plan: **`api/SECURITY.md`**.

---

## Roadmap

Decisions already locked (see `api/SECURITY.md` → *Decisions & findings*):

- **Tenancy target = "a few trusted people."** ⇒ `INJECT_SHARED_CREDS=false`,
  git via per-repo GitHub App tokens, no Cloudflare deploy for users, per-user PDS proxy.
- **Tangled ruled out as the live git remote** — CF Containers are HTTP/HTTPS-egress-only
  and tangled is SSH-only, so a container can't push to it. GitHub-over-HTTPS is the
  live remote; tangled stays an Actions-driven publish/mirror target.
- **uv adopted** in the container image.

Phased plan:

1. ✅ `/ws` identity gate.
2. ✅ Capability token + `/sync` DID-scoping + `INJECT_SHARED_CREDS` gate.
3. **Ship the backend** — enable CF Containers, set `CAP_SIGNING_KEY`, create
   `os-workspace` R2, attach `os-api.minomobi.com`, set `ALLOWED_DIDS` to the
   trusted set, build the frontend with `VITE_CONTAINER_API_URL`. *(This is the
   gate between "frontend demo" and "the container actually works.")*
4. **PDS-MCP server + `/pds/*` proxy** — the differentiated feature; safe even
   single-tenant. Agent reads/writes the user's own PDS, token never in the shell.
5. **GitHub App + `/git/*` broker** — per-repo ~1h installation tokens over HTTPS,
   git credential helper in the container. No GitHub token persists in the shell.
6. **Hardening** — WS one-time ticket (off the query string), container egress
   allowlist, per-DID R2 quota + sync size cap, per-DID rate limits.

### Still open (owner's call)
- **Does the trusted set need git at all,** or is the agent's job "operate on your
  PDS + publish a site"? If the latter, skip §5 and the surface shrinks a lot.
- **Where does user-generated output get hosted?** R2 under a *cookieless* domain
  is the safe default — never `*.mino.mobi` (shares the SSO cookie).
- **Phase-2 ATProto OAuth** (PKCE+DPoP) to retire app passwords — fold into the
  shared `auth.mino.mobi` worker, or keep `os` self-contained?
