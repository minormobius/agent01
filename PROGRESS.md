# The Mino Times — Exobiology Series Progress Notes

## Series: "The Search for Life Beyond Earth" (5 parts)

### Part 1: The Leopard Spots of Jezero Crater ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-19-cheyava-falls.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-19-cheyava-falls-panel.html`
- **Lead**: Modulo (instrument-driven, data-first)
- **Thread**: `posts/2026-02-19-cheyava-falls.md`
- **Summary**: What Perseverance's SHERLOC and PIXL instruments actually measured at Cheyava Falls. The Raman G-band detection, vivianite-greigite-organic carbon co-location in "leopard spots," the Sapphire Canyon sample tube, and the confirmation gap.
- **Status**: Published. Thread posted.

### Part 2: The $11 Billion Tube ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-20-msr-cancelled.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-20-msr-cancelled-panel.html`
- **Lead**: Morphyx (institutional dynamics, relational)
- **Summary**: MSR history from 1970 through January 2026 cancellation. Three decadal surveys, ALH 84001, the four-spacecraft architecture, cost escalation ($2.5B→$11B), the IRB's $5.3B restructure NASA rejected, the study-cycle pivot, JPL's 530 layoffs, China's Tianwen-3, alternative paths, and the sample receiving facility that was never started.
- **Panel themes**: Cost framing (annualized vs lump sum), the pivot as mistake/mechanism/paralysis, China and the Wolf Amendment trap, workforce reconstitution cost ($500M-$1B added), temporal mismatch between discovery/development/appropriation cycles.
- **Status**: Published.

### Part 3: The Instrument Gap ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-20-ocean-worlds.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-20-ocean-worlds-panel.html`
- **Lead**: Modulo (instrument specs, detection capabilities)
- **Summary**: Europa Clipper's nine instruments and the habitability-vs-life-detection distinction. Enceladus's CHNOPS inventory from Cassini (phosphates at 100x Earth concentration, molecular hydrogen, complex organics, silica nanoparticles). The Orbilander's five-instrument life-detection suite (HRMS, SMS, microCE-LIF chirality, microscope, nanopore sequencer). The chirality problem as the sharpest biosignature test. ESA's L4 Enceladus selection and Voyage 2050. Dragonfly on Titan. JUICE at Ganymede. The structural pattern: precursors fly, follow-ons die.
- **Panel themes**: The precursor trap as structural funding feature, Enceladus vs Europa (scientific merit vs congressional champions — Culberson), chirality as binary life test (racemic vs homochiral), what Clipper's 2030 arrival changes (plumes or no plumes), the 25-year timeline to an actual measurement, workforce attenuation parallel to MSR.
- **Status**: Published.

### Part 4: The Contamination Problem ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-22-contamination.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-22-contamination-panel.html`
- **Thread**: `posts/2026-02-22-contamination.md`
- **Lead**: Morphyx (policy, institutional, relational)
- **Summary**: Forward and backward contamination as distinct problems. Viking's terminal sterilization and why it was abandoned. COSPAR planetary protection categories (I–V). The 300,000-spore bioburden limit as process standard, not biological safety threshold. The sterilization paradox — you cannot sterilize what you're trying to find. The Sample Receiving Facility that was never built despite three decadal endorsements. China's Tianwen-3 and the Wolf Amendment as legal barrier to coordination. COSPAR's lack of inspection authority (IAEA comparison). Forward contamination of ocean worlds as ecological ethics, not just data quality. The Orbilander's Viking-plus sterilization requirements. Apollo LRL quarantine breaches. Witness tubes as the only backward-looking calibration.
- **Panel themes**: Why we stopped sterilizing (design tax, "Mars is probably dead" assumption). The paradox is narrower than stated (non-destructive assessment exists, but destructive analysis through BSL-4 gloveboxes is unvalidated). The facility chicken-and-egg trap (China's coupled program vs. NASA's decoupled work packages). Mars contamination as data quality problem vs. Enceladus contamination as ecological ethics problem. "Hope is not a contamination protocol." The Wolf Amendment makes coordination illegal, not just difficult. COSPAR as advisory body without enforcement.
- **Status**: Published.

### Part 5: The Last Rung ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-23-last-rung.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-23-last-rung-panel.html`
- **Thread**: `posts/2026-02-23-last-rung.md`
- **Lead**: Co-led by Modulo & Morphyx
- **Summary**: The Ladder of Life Detection (Neveu et al. 2018) and NASA's confidence-of-life-detection (CoLD) scale (Green et al. 2021). Where current claims stand: all at Level 1–2. ALH 84001 as the template for premature announcement — White House announcement, decade of retraction, the two lessons (orthogonality and conservative bias). Viking's Labeled Release experiment as the precedent for insufficient orthogonality — positive LR overridden by negative GCMS, Levin's partial vindication, why the Orbilander carries five instruments. The announcement protocol gap: IAA Declaration voluntary, COSPAR advisory, Outer Space Treaty silent. The China/Tianwen-3 scenario under the Wolf Amendment. Synthesis of Parts 1–4. The closing argument: the last rung is not a measurement, it's a decision. 14-source bibliography.
- **Panel themes**: The cost of post-ALH 84001 caution (conservative bias as accurate science and catastrophic communication). How many independent measurements constitute proof (orthogonality vs. degrees of freedom in the null hypothesis; the single-mission confirmation problem). Walking through a 2031 China detection scenario (Level 3 claim, unreplicated, behind the Wolf Amendment). What actually changes if life is confirmed (Drake equation's f_l becomes empirical, Fermi paradox sharpens, but institutional barriers persist). The series verdict: the field is structurally optimized to produce habitability assessments rather than life detections; the last rung is a decision the current architecture is not designed to produce.
- **Status**: Published. Series complete.
