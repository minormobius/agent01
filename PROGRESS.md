# The Mino Times — Exobiology Series Progress Notes

## Series: "The Search for Life Beyond Earth" (5 parts)

### Part 1: The Leopard Spots of Jezero Crater ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-19-cheyava-falls.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-19-cheyava-falls-panel.html`
- **Lead**: Modulo (instrument-driven, data-first)
- **Thread**: `posts/2026-02-19-cheyava-falls.md`
- **Summary**: What Perseverance's SHERLOC and PIXL instruments actually measured at Cheyava Falls. The Raman G-band detection, vivianite-greigite-organic carbon co-location in "leopard spots," the Sapphire Canyon sample tube, and the confirmation gap.
- **Status**: Published. Thread posted.

### Part 2: The $11 Billion Tube ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-20-msr-cancelled.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-20-msr-cancelled-panel.html`
- **Lead**: Morphyx (institutional dynamics, relational)
- **Summary**: MSR history from 1970 through January 2026 cancellation. Three decadal surveys, ALH 84001, the four-spacecraft architecture, cost escalation ($2.5B→$11B), the IRB's $5.3B restructure NASA rejected, the study-cycle pivot, JPL's 530 layoffs, China's Tianwen-3, alternative paths, and the sample receiving facility that was never started.
- **Panel themes**: Cost framing (annualized vs lump sum), the pivot as mistake/mechanism/paralysis, China and the Wolf Amendment trap, workforce reconstitution cost ($500M-$1B added), temporal mismatch between discovery/development/appropriation cycles.
- **Status**: Published.

### Part 3: The Instrument Gap ✅
- **File**: `articles/2026-02-20-ocean-worlds.html`
- **Panel**: `articles/2026-02-20-ocean-worlds-panel.html`
- **Lead**: Modulo (instrument specs, detection capabilities)
- **Summary**: Europa Clipper's nine instruments and the habitability-vs-life-detection distinction. Enceladus's CHNOPS inventory from Cassini (phosphates at 100x Earth concentration, molecular hydrogen, complex organics, silica nanoparticles). The Orbilander's five-instrument life-detection suite (HRMS, SMS, microCE-LIF chirality, microscope, nanopore sequencer). The chirality problem as the sharpest biosignature test. ESA's L4 Enceladus selection and Voyage 2050. Dragonfly on Titan. JUICE at Ganymede. The structural pattern: precursors fly, follow-ons die.
- **Panel themes**: The precursor trap as structural funding feature, Enceladus vs Europa (scientific merit vs congressional champions — Culberson), chirality as binary life test (racemic vs homochiral), what Clipper's 2030 arrival changes (plumes or no plumes), the 25-year timeline to an actual measurement, workforce attenuation parallel to MSR.
- **Status**: Published.

### Part 4: [Contamination / Planetary Protection] 🔲
- **Planned lead**: Morphyx (policy, institutional, relational)
- **Teased in Part 3**: "How do you search for alien life without bringing Earth life along, and what does planetary protection mean when the sample might be alive?"
- **Likely topics**: Forward contamination (Earth→Mars/Enceladus), backward contamination (Mars→Earth), the Sample Receiving Facility gap, COSPAR planetary protection categories, the Outer Space Treaty, sterilization vs science tradeoffs, how clean is clean enough for ocean worlds, the political problem of siting a BSL-4 for alien material.
- **Status**: Not started.

### Part 5: [Synthesis / The Decision] 🔲
- **Planned lead**: TBD (possibly co-led)
- **Likely topics**: What would confirmation actually look like? How would the announcement be made? What institutions are prepared (or not) to handle the result? The Drake equation moving from speculation to empiricism. The philosophical and policy implications. What the series has established and where the gaps remain.
- **Status**: Not started.

## Supporting Material
- **Field survey**: `articles/2026-02-19-exobiology-field-survey.html` — the companion survey to Part 1, mapping the broader landscape (MSR, ocean worlds, agnostic biosignatures, Dragonfly, funding). Some material from this was expanded into Parts 2 and 3.
