# ken — ken.mino.mobi

<!-- SEEDED by scripts/gen-surface-docs.mjs, now HAND-OWNED — edit directly.
     Repo-wide rules live in ../CLAUDE.md; the surface index is
     ../docs/SURFACES.md. -->

The study programme behind `loop` and `plant`, given its own surface: **the
measurement of unattended work, treated as a field.** Two standing documents —
a curriculum and a protocol — in journal dress.

## Facts

| Surface | `ken` |
| Dir | `ken/` |
| Endpoint | `ken.mino.mobi` |

Machine-readable entry: [`deploy-registry.json`](../deploy-registry.json) → `surfaces[]` where `surface == "ken"`.

## The domain is attached — verified

`ken.mino.mobi` is **live and bound to worker `ken`**, confirmed 2026-08-22 on
the first deploy (run #1): `/`, `/syllabus` and `/protocol` all return 200 with
the expected content.

Worth recording precisely, because the surface was built expecting otherwise.
[`docs/DEPLOYS.md`](../docs/DEPLOYS.md) §7 lists attaching a custom domain as
dashboard-only, and `curl -sI https://ken.mino.mobi` returned 502 before the
first deploy. In fact **wrangler created the custom domain itself** from the
`routes` block — the zone is already in the account, so the API token had
enough authority. §7's rule is about account topology it genuinely cannot
change; a new hostname on an existing zone is not that.

The golden rule still applies to every future change here: if you rename the
worker or move the domain, **verify the deploy log binds
`ken.mino.mobi (custom domain)`**. Green is not proof.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | masthead, aims and scope, and the editorial on the pilot run |
| `syllabus.html` | **Article I**, the seven-unit curriculum. Served at `/syllabus`. |
| `methods.html` | **Article II**, the house standard for model experiments. Served at `/methods`. |
| `protocol.html` | **Article III**, the Stage 1 registered-report skeleton. Served at `/protocol`. |
| `refs.js` | **the bibliography, as data** — 54 real works, keyed |
| `cite.js` | numbers citations in document order, renders the reference list |
| `journal.css` | the shared journal typography; prints to real Letter pages |
| `worker.js` | thin assets worker; maps `/syllabus` and `/protocol` to their `.html` |
| `prose-lint.mjs` | the tic lint; importable, and runnable standalone |
| `ken.selftest.mjs` | the gate. **Run it before touching anything here** |

`CLAUDE.md`, `ken.selftest.mjs` and `prose-lint.mjs` are `.assetsignore`d; everything else ships.

## Three gates, and why each exists

```bash
node ken/ken.selftest.mjs     # ~1s, 558 checks
node ken/prose-lint.mjs       # the tic lint alone, with --verbose for hits
```

### 1. Every work cited here is real, and the citation is machine-checked

Pages never hand-number citations. They write `<a class="cite"
data-ref="holmstrom1991"></a>` and leave an empty `<ol id="reflist">`; `cite.js`
numbers in document order and renders the list. Add a work to `refs.js`, cite it
by key, and the numbering takes care of itself.

The selftest asserts across every page that each `data-ref` resolves, that every
entry in `refs.js` is cited at least once (an uncited entry is usually a sign a
section was cut), that every entry carries author, year, title and venue, and
that no key is declared twice.

### 2. The figures in the prose still match the record

The site makes numerical claims about three prior runs. All of them are
recomputed on every build:

| Source | Claims checked |
|---|---|
| `.github/loop/{turns,runs}.jsonl` | 99 orders, 89 turns, 17 gate failures, 59 of 89 at the probe ceiling, 0 quality scores, 1 of 3 signals fired |
| `bakeoff/results/race-01/results.json` | 11 runs, 11/11 gate, 11/11 primitives, judges `null`, 2 entries with a zero patch beside a real entry directory |
| `bakeoff/results/race-02/results.json` | 12 runs, 12/12 gate, 12/12 primitives, judges `null` |

`deploy-ken.yml` triggers on those paths as well as on `ken/**`, so re-enabling
the loop or running another bake-off **turns this surface red until the prose is
rewritten**. That is the designed behaviour and the reason the check exists.

### 3. The prose passes the tic lint

`prose-lint.mjs` is a density lint for the constructions catalogued in the
declauding register: em-dash density, negation-first reveal ("It is not X. It is
Y."), significance designation ("load-bearing", "what actually matters"),
abstraction agency ("the table shows", "the number lies"), aphoristic closers,
coy or thesis-shaped headers, fragment cadence, unearned intensifiers, one-line
paragraph share, and sentence-length monotony.

Two things about it are deliberate:

- **It is a density check, not a ban.** Every construction is legitimate once.
  The documented failure of over-correcting is prose with uniform sentence
  length, no first-person judgement and no digression, which is worse than the
  tics. If a rule fires and the sentence is right, widen the budget in
  `prose-lint.mjs` and say why in the commit.
- **Lexical rules read `<p>`, `<li>` and `<td>`; structural rules read `<p>`
  only.** An em-dash in a table cell is the same tic as one in a paragraph, and
  an earlier version reading only `<p>` let twelve of them hide in one page's
  tables. But a table cell is *supposed* to be short, so flagging it for
  paragraph length is noise.

Headers are the rule worth internalising, because it is absolute rather than a
density: a header names its section, it does not tease or argue it. "Known gaps
in this standard", not "What this standard does not yet cover".

## Why it looks like a journal, and why that is not a joke

The register is borrowed from [`wormhole`](../wormhole/), which generates entire
fabricated literatures — plausible papers, plausible citations, plausible fields,
all invented, all deterministic from a seed. The two surfaces are a **matched
pair and should stay legible as one**: same paper-sheet-on-viewer-ground idiom,
same print-to-Letter behaviour, same booktabs tables.

The difference is the point. `wormhole` demonstrates how cheaply the apparatus
of scholarship can be counterfeited. `ken` therefore has to be able to *prove*
it is not counterfeit, and a machine-checked bibliography is the only form of
that proof worth anything. If you ever find yourself wanting to add a citation
you have not read, add it to `wormhole` instead — that is what it is for.

## What is deliberately unfinished

`protocol.html` publishes **six named blanks** (§4, B1–B6) rather than filling
them: a defined construct, an estimated reliability, a calibrated judge, a
powered sample size, a stopping rule, and an outside signal. Each is the
deliverable of a curriculum unit, and the protocol is not registrable until all
six close.

**Do not fill a blank with a plausible number.** Closing one means the unit was
done and the quantity was measured; anything else re-creates the exact failure
this surface exists to document. When a blank does close, update §4's table,
add the figure, and note the date.

## Things worth knowing before editing

- **The unit order in the syllabus is load-bearing.** Unit IV's shrinkage factor
  *is* Unit I's reliability — the same algebra from two ends — and Unit VI's
  results are anecdotes without Unit V's Bradley–Terry machinery. Reordering
  breaks the argument, not just the pacing.
- **The editorial's caveat paragraph is not padding.** The faint downward drift
  in `probes` and the near-doubling of gate failures are *not* evidence quality
  declined; the first is not significant and the second is confounded with task
  difficulty. Any rewrite that quietly upgrades those into findings is exactly
  the error the surface is about.
- **`worker.js` exists only for the two clean URLs.** If you add a third
  article, add it to the `clean` map or it will 404 without its `.html`.
- The stylesheet commits to a light paper sheet on a dark viewer ground, like
  its sibling. That is deliberate — a journal is paper — so don't bolt on a dark
  mode without deciding the pair should diverge.

## Deploying

Pushes to `claude/repo-study-fields-0ftd34` that touch `ken/**` trigger
[`.github/workflows/deploy-ken.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-ken.yml), which
runs the selftest as a gate and then `wrangler deploy`. The sandbox cannot reach
Cloudflare — **push to the trigger branch, don't `wrangler deploy` locally.**
Read [`docs/DEPLOYS.md`](../docs/DEPLOYS.md) first, and see the domain warning at
the top of this file.
